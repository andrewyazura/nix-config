# Senior Architect

Strategic guidance for software architecture decisions, system design, and technical trade-offs.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when you need help with:

- **System Architecture Design**: Designing scalable, maintainable systems from scratch or refactoring existing ones
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Creating visual representations of system components, data flows, and interactions
- **Tech Stack Decisions**: Evaluating and choosing between technologies, frameworks, and tools
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Analyzing architectural trade-offs (performance vs. complexity, consistency vs. availability, etc.)
- **Integration Patterns**: Defining how services, APIs, and components should communicate
- **Dependency Analysis**: Understanding and optimizing dependencies between system components

## Core Competencies

### Architecture Patterns
- Microservices vs. Monolith
- Event-driven architecture
- CQRS and Event Sourcing
- Clean/Hexagonal Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- API Gateway patterns
- Service mesh architecture

### System Design Principles
- Scalability strategies (horizontal/vertical)
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Data consistency models (CAP theorem)
- Caching strategies (CDN, Redis, application-level)
- Load balancing and service discovery
- Security architecture (authentication, authorization, encryption)

### Tech Stack

**Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Swift, Kotlin

**Frontend:** React, Next.js, React Native, Flutter

**Backend:** Node.js, Express, GraphQL, REST APIs

**Database:** PostgreSQL, Prisma, NeonDB, Supabase

**Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, CircleCI

**Cloud:** AWS, GCP, Azure

## Approach

This skill follows the user's stated preferences:
1. **Research first, code later**: Explore architecture thoroughly before proposing solutions
2. **Present ALL options**: Don't pre-filter—show multiple viable approaches with trade-offs
3. **Strategic guidance**: Focus on insights, analysis, and decision frameworks
4. **Context7 integration**: Leverage up-to-date documentation for frameworks and libraries
